    <h1>Philp Salt</h1>
    <p>
        Born in Wales but raised in Barbados, Salt's interests quickly switched from football to cricket.<br />
        He had watched Manchester City home and away growing up, but the move to the Caribbean inspired
        a desire to play cricket, and play it aggressively. He won a scholarship to play cricket at
        a desire to play cricket, <br />Reed School in Surrey, from where he was recommended to Keith Medlycott and joined their 
        academy. He made a first-team debut in August 2015, but it wasn't until 2018 that he really 
        broke through.
