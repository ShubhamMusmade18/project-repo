    <h1>Bhuvneshwar Kumar</h1>
    <p>
        Bhuvneshwar's rise in white-ball cricket mirrored his success in the IPL.<br />
        He was handed a contract by Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2009 but went 
        two seasons without playing a game in the tournament.<br /> After another three 
        unremarkable seasons with Pune Warriors, he was signed by Sunrisers 
        Hyderabad in 2014, and quickly rose through the ranks to become the 
        lynchpin of their powerplay and death bowling.<br /> He took upwards of 18 
        wickets in each of his first four seasons, won the purple cap two years 
        in a row, in 2016 and 2017, and was instrumental in Sunrisers' only title win, 
        in 2016.<br /> Though his performances tapered off in later seasons, he remains the
        franchise's all-time leading wicket-taker.
