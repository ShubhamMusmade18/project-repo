    <h1>Rajat Patidar</h1>
    <p>
        Rajat Patidar made his comeback to the RCB side in the 2022 season 
        as a replacement for injured wicketkeeper-batter Luvnith Sisodia.<br /> 
        Hailing from Madhya Pradesh, Patidar was the highest run-scorer for 
        his state team in the 2018-19 Ranji Trophy season.<br /> With a strike rate
        of more than 140 in the Indian T20 domestic circuit, he is a handy bat
        at the top of the order.
